Algorithm for Sum of all Even Numbers:--

steps:--
step1: Create a funtion 
step2: Declare a variable to store the sum of the even numbers upto N-sum = 0
step3: Run for loop from 0 to N
step4: Check if the given numbers is an even number or not.
step5: If J % 2 == 0 then calculate the sum of even Numbers.
step6: Return the sum 
Step7: Create a variable named "num" to store the value of N.
step8: call the funtion and pass "num" as an argument in it.
step9: print the output.
